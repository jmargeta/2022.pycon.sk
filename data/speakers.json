He ran a little agency called Naïve (“Why don’t you just call yourselves ‘Stupid’?”) until he joined forces with Olly in 2000, starting Torchbox with the aim of building beautiful online software for people who make the world a better place. As Technical Director, Tom is responsible for making sure the things we build are fast and reliable and easy to maintain. He manages the tech team and account directs many of our large technical projects. Along with Olly, Tom tries to make Torchbox a fun and inspiring place to work. Tom lives with his family in the countryside. He reads novels and gets cross at tennis. He plays in three bands who will probably never make it. He composed the theme tune to Charlie and Lola.",
